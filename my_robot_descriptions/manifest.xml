  <!-- Package summary -->
  <description brief="A collection of robot descriptions.">

    This package is a collection of urdf (and possibly other) files describing various robots.  Most
    robots have descriptions in their own robot-specific packages, but these descriptions are often
    written in inconsistent or even incorrect ways, using differing naming conventions and improper
    namespace handling.  In particular, many robot descriptions do not properly allow all topics to
    be pushed into a particular namespace, which causes problems for multi-robot setups.  This
    package tries to clean up these robot descriptions and present them in a consistent manner,
    while also providing a place to store customised robot descriptions.

    By convention, urdf robot descriptions are normally uploaded to a "robot_description" key in the
    parameter server on launch.  Some ROS nodes and gazebo plugins assume that this convention is
    followed, and some things may actually break if this is not done.  The intention is to avoid
    such dependencies, but in some cases this may be difficult, so by default the convention should
    normally be followed.

    The urdf descriptions are stored in *.urdf.xacro format, and they should be edited directly.
    This means we don't have to build this package to "process" the xacro files.  Instead, xacro can
    be used to load the descriptions into the parameter server.

    The preferred way of handling robot descriptions involves the following files:

      urdf/
        common.xacro          - common xacro definitions
        (part).urdf[.xacro]   - urdf definition for a robot part/sensor (robot element has no name)

      robots/
        (robot).urdf[.xacro]  - urdf definition for a robot (robot element has name)

    By convention, each robot should subscribe to the following topics in its namespace:

      geometry_msgs/Twist   cmd_vel   Desired 6D velocity (subset of the fields are considered)
      (...add entries for other controllers)

    By convention each robot may publish the following topics in its namespace:

      nav_msgs/Odometry     pose_ground_truth   Ground truth 6D pose
      nav_msgs/Odometry     odom                Odometric updates in 6D
      nav_msgs/Odometry     imu                 Inertial updates in 6D
      (...add entries for other sensors)
