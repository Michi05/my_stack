  <!-- Package summary -->
  <description brief="A collection of launch files.">

    This package is a collection of launch files used to launch various robots in gazebo.  The idea
    is that launching these files should be equivalent to powering on the created robots.  Drivers
    for controllers and sensors will normally have to be connected separately, as needed.  By
    convention, urdf robot descriptions are uploaded to a "robot_description" key in the parameter
    server on launch.  See the "my_robot_descriptions" package for more information about this.
