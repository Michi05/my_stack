  <!-- Package summary -->
  <description brief="my_gazebo_worlds is a collection of world, model, urdf, and launch files">

    This package is a collection of world, model, urdf, and launch files used to launch various
    robots in various gazebo worlds.

    Since gazebo needs world files to be passed as physical files, *.world.xacro files are
    converted to *.world files when building the package.  Only *.world.xacro files should be
    edited (rather than *.world files), and the package should be built after all edits.

    By convention, robot descriptions (urdf or model) are processed with xacro and uploaded to a
    "robot_description" key in the parameter server on launch.  Some ROS nodes and gazebo plugins
    assume that this convention is followed, and some things may break if this is not done.  This
    approach also means that one doesn't need to remember to rebuild the package in order to apply
    changes to robot description files.  Some robot descriptions have been copied locally to allow
    for customisations and cleanup.

    By convention, each robot may subscribe to the following topics in its namespace:

      geometry_msgs/Twist   cmd_vel   Desired 6D velocity (subset of the fields are considered)
      (...add entries for other controllers)

    By convention each robot may publish the following topics in its namespace:

      nav_msgs/Odometry     pose_ground_truth   Ground truth 6D pose
      nav_msgs/Odometry     odom                Odometric updates
      nav_msgs/Odometry     imu                 Inertial updates
      (...add entries for other sensors)
