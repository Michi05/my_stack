  <!-- Package summary -->
  <description brief="A collection of world, model, and launch files.">

    This package is a collection of world, model, and launch files used to launch various robots in
    various gazebo worlds.  The idea is that launching these files should be equivalent to powering
    on the created robots.  Controllers and sensors should be connected separately.

    Since gazebo needs world files to be passed as physical files, *.world.xacro files are
    converted to *.world files when building the package.  Only *.world.xacro files should be
    edited (rather than *.world files), and the package should be built after all edits.
